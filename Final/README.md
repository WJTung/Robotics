# Protection System Using Automatic Human Tracking And Identifying With Kinect 2

We design a protection system which is able to track human and attack invaders with the rubber band gun. When encountering a stranger, the robot will control the vehicle motors and track the stranger with *Kinect 2* and *Open CV*. While the distance is short enough, it will play a sound file generated from *python gtts package*, asking the person to show his or her student ID card to the *RFID reader*. If no ID card is shown or an unknown ID is detected, the system will calculate corresponding rotation angles for *servo motors* to aim at the invader, and switch the *relay* to turn on the shooting motor. The invader will be attacked by the rubber band gun. Please refer to *team2.pdf* for more details.
